## What is Pages CMS?

[Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org) is an Open Source Content Management System built for static websites (Jekyll, Next.js, VuePress, Hugo, etc).

It allows you to edit your website's content directly on GitHub (and soon GitLab and Bitbucket) via a user-friendly interface.

## Use the online version

The easiest way to get started is to use [the online version of Pages CMS](https://app.pagescms.org). You'll be able to log in with your GitHub account and get the latest version of Pages CMS.

This online version is identical to what's in the repo and nothing is saved in the backend (OAuth tokens are saved on the client side).

## Install or deploy your own version

However, you can install your own version locally or deploy it (for free) on Cloudflare following the steps below.
